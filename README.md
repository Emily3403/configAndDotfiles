# My Config and Dotfile backup
This repository is meant as a backup for my personal linux configuration.
It can easily be installed to any system using [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/). 

# Scope 
The installation should be as seamless as executing a file and letting it run.


# Attention
This repository is currely **unstable**. The only possible thing is to view the backuped config and download that.
